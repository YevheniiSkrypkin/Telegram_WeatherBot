# Telegram_WeatherBot
This is my first try to create a Telegram Bot using Telegraf API, Weather API and Node-Geocoder.

Bot is running on Node.js.

To launch bot using cmd line run command 'node index.js'

This bot is not located on any server, so it is available only when launched.

This is a PUBLIC build, to use it fully - you need to get your own API Keys for LocationIQ, WeatherAPI and of course - Telegram Bot API Key.

-----------------------------------------------

You can install all required packages using npm. 

1. Telegraf - npm install telegraf // https://telegraf.js.org/ some info can be found here, as well as here https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
2. WeatherAPI - npm install theweatherapi // https://www.weatherapi.com/
3. Node-Geocoder - npm install node-geocoder // https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-geocoder or https://github.com/nchaulet/node-geocoder

------------------------------------------------

This is a very basic try, but you may find useful some of my solution, feel free to use
