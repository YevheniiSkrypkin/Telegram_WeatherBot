# Telegram_WeatherBot
This is my first try to create a Telegram Bot using Telegraf API, Weather API and Node-Geocoder.

Bot is running on Node.js.

To launch bot using cmd line< run command 'node index.js'

This bot is not located on any server, so it is available only when launched.

This is a PUBLIC build, to use it fully - you need to get your own API Keys for LocationIQ, WeatherAPI and of course - Telegram Bot API Key.
